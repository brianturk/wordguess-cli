## What this project does
The "Word Guess App" allows you to play a "hangman" style game.  The app selects a random word from a random word API and to win you have to guess the word before being wrong 10 times.


## Additional Notes
* To make the random word API work, you need an API key in the .env file.  This is available for free at the API URL.  
RANDOM_WORD_KEY=[your key]
